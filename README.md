# Crime Watch

## Capstone Project I 

With everything going on in the world people want to know what is/has been going on around them so they can make sure they are safe. With Crime Watch, people will be able to see and report crimes that have occured in an area and where they occurred. 

Color coded indicators will show on a map using the google maps api where each crime took place and using data from the FBI api, clicking on the indicator will show the type of crime, the date the crime took place, and whatever useful information there is about the crime. Users will be able to search for certain areas and types of crimes and be shown data based on their search. Users will also be able to report crimes in an area which will also be displayed. User reported crimes will be displayed differently than crimes from the FBI api and stored in the internal database. It is advised that users report any crime to the proper authorities as Crime Watch wonâ€™t be able to. Perhaps that can be integrated later. Users will also be able to confirm or deny the reports of other users in order to make sure reports are trustworthy. Notifications can be sent either through email or text, if allowed, to users to alert them of new crime in the area. 

Users that are not logged in will still be able to see the crime map, but they will not be able to report or confirm crimes or recieve notifications.
